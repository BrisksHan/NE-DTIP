python version: 3.6

package require: numpy scipy gensim networkx

the version will be added soon.

The approach take DTI network, Drug Strucutural Similarity Network and Taget Sequence Similarity Network as input.

There are demo provided. The input should be pkl file of networkx object. 

Later, we will add a new function to take .txt file as input.
